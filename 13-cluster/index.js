// Cluster in Node.js is used to run multiple instances of Node.js that can distribute workload among the app threads
// Cluster is module in node.js used to create multiple worker process that share same port
// Each worker run on separate CPU core, enabling node.js to use multiple-core system and handle traffic

// why use cluster?
// we know node.js is single threaded, by default it uses only one CPU core or thread
// cluster helps scale node.js app horizontally on single machine by creating multiple worker process running on sep cores hanling more concurrent req and high-traffic

// working:
// master process: control and manage worker process
// it forks or  distributes incoming connection using round-robin 

// worker process: actual instances of Node.js app handling req
// each worker run independently on separate core but same port
